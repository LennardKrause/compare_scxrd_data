# compare_scxrd_data
Script to show systematic trends between two data sets. It employs a visual difference-divided-by-mean approach plotted as a function of (the logarithm of) the mean intensity and uses an unbiased relative difference between two data sets, where neither can initially be established as the reference point. In this plot, the allowed values range from âˆ’2 to 2 and a complete lack of bias is indicated by values close to zero. The scaling of the data for comparison is arbitrary, as is typically the case for X-ray diffraction data. To supplement this plot, a direct comparison of the intensities of one set versus the intensities of the other set is given on both linear and logarithmic scales.
